10/15/15: the "get_isochrone_struct" program returns requested columns of a given age in Table format, and also makes a 4-panel plot.

Note: I commented out line 13 from zp00.dat so that the column names are automatically found by astropy.io.ascii.read, but this means that user-supplied 'quantities' values must match the header names in that file exactly.

11/02/15: added a plotting routine ("plot_iso") to the isochrones module. Example output is included (cmd.png).

Note: to achieve the desired result without having to be at NMSU or logged into NMSU, I made a copy your isochrone directory. Line 10 will need to be modified for you to run this.

11/17/15: thanks to a lot of help from Jon, finally made the damned Hess diagram in Python (isochrones.py/plot_hess), including FITS image output. Example output if included here ("hess_10.1gyr..."). There are still issues, such as the x-axis going the wrong direction. I made numerous attempts to correct this, without success.
