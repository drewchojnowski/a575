\section{What I Did}

In the previous question, I failed to complete parts (d) and (e). My function produces the following result for the integral split into 10 pieces...

In [2]: print a.func3(10)

0.0

2578.36817871

4426.45979984

5697.26375145

6525.76688188

7028.9532352

7305.80279474

7437.28921763

7486.37513769

7497.99973247 (final sum)

...which is not getting anywhere close to the analytical answer. I don't know why.

My reaction to non-success in this part is best expressed in Figure~\ref{kittenfig}, which shows a sad little kitten whose mommy is nowhere in sight.
