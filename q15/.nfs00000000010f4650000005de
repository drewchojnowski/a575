\section{Background}

Blablabla said Nobody ~\cite{Nobody06}.

The galaxy Mrk 266 (NGC 5256, $z\sim0.0279$) is of great astrophysical interest due to its remarkable properties. It is a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) composed of two merging galaxies (presumably disk galaxies), one of which (SW) posseses a Seyfert 2 nucleus and the other of which (NE) exhibits LINER properties . The overall morphology of the system is chaotic and includes a cloud of AGN-ionized gas ($>$30 kpc from SW nucleus to tip of cloud) north of the double nuclei. suggest the stream is photoionized by the brighter NE nucleus. Another noteworthy component of Mrk 266 is a bright radio source, lacking optical counterpart, between the two AGN performed long-slit spectroscopy of the large gas cloud in Mrk 266 and discovered a peculiar offset ($\sim50$ $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) in the northern regions between the velocities of [O~III] versus Balmer series emission lines. A color image of Mrk 266 from \citep{2012AJ....144..125M} is displayed in Figure 1.


\section{Morphological Classification}

In low-resulotion images, Mrk 266 can be broadly classified as a peculiar system of merging AGN host galaxies. Using an exquisite multi-wavelength imaging data set, classified the NE galaxy as S0/a (pec) and the SW galaxy as SBb (pec). It would be impossible to arrive at similarly detailed classifications based on the SDSS images discussed below.
